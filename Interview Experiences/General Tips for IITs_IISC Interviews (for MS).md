**General Tips for IITs/IISC Interviews (for MS)**


1. If you are asked about your **research interests** , it&#39;s always safe to say that Sir, I have not yet figured out where my research interest lies, I would like to try new things during MS and explore my interests.
2. There would be many topics for which we prepare by seeing videos on Youtube. For answering gate questions, **they may be enough for GATE, but for interviews in IIT, unless and until you know a topic thoroughly, don&#39;t claim that you know something.**
3. If the interviewer asks tell me **something about yourself,** think well, and say because those words which you say will **drive your interview.**
4. I felt they were not satisfied with intuitive definitions and were expecting more mathematical answers.
5. Be clear on which areas you want to be questioned and **choose the panel accordingly.**
6. Professors will give a lot of **hints** , keep trying, don&#39;t give up on any question easily.
7. **Don&#39;t bluff.** They are the god of their field.
8. Be polite and humble.
9. Someone else said: I attended interviews in almost all the IITs for Ph.D. and felt that MS interviews are of the same nature. Professors usually test students&#39; analytical skills, and ask question form the topics that we usually think hard and can skip during exam preparations.
10. Good in-depth knowledge at least about one subject.
11. Good understanding of basics of other subjects (at least know the basic concepts and terminology)
12. they give some hint if we stuck somewhere.
13. See this vid for MSR: it will give u very good guidance/motivation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbSGJfTj9zw&amp;t=1785s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbSGJfTj9zw&amp;t=1785s)
14. They can ask **ANYthing**. (From XII, B.tech subj, ML, MOOCs, etc), and it&#39;s not something for which u can prepare in 2,3 or 5 days. Any knowledge can help, â€¦. BUT wait:- you can DRIVE your interview.( you know it by experience).
15. Know it well that **what you know and in what subjects you are not comfortable** , it will help to direct your interviews well.
16. **You can frankly say I don&#39;t know this, and I know these all subjects. So that they will not ask what you don&#39;t know.**
17. If you know about the research area of the interviewer, then it will increase your chances if you say that I wanted to work in so &amp; so research area. (because they are also looking for students who can work under them only) ( it happened with me in one of the IIT, I said I wanted to work in NLP, and hopefully, he was working in NLP for the past 20 years. And I got selected there.)
18. Intro should be short. They don&#39;t have much time, You will get only 20 min to prove yourself.
19. Check the Teaching sections of the interviewer before you know the name.
20. If you don&#39;t know something and you are feeling that they might jump into that topic, then say beforehand that I am good at this &amp; this, but not with this.
