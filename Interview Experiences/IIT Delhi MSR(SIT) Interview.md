# **IIT Delhi MSR Interview**

# **(School of IT)**

The cutoff was: 700 gate score. UG marks : 70% (7 CGPA)

My GATE score: 731 general. (rank 510)

**37 candidates** were shortlisted using this cutoff for the Interview.

They have divided them into 2 categories (based on AI and non-AI).

Interviews were conducted on 18th June only.

The interview was online via Microsoft teams.

There were 3 to 4 professors in the meeting. But only 2 of them asked me.

I1: Suraj, What are the other places where you have applied?

Me: Sir, IIT Bombay, and Madras.

I1: which program?

Me: MS Research only at all places.

I1: have you not applied in IITD cse?

Me: yes sir, IITD also I&#39;ve applied.

I1: Tell me about your background.

Me: I am a final year student in Computer science eng. I wanted to do MSR in AI. So I have studied Linear Algebra and Probability to prepare for that.

( I kept my intro crisp &amp; to the point, bcoz after giving too many interviews, now I knew that interview time is generally fixed and v. less ( 20-30 min only), so use it wisely).

I1: Ok, I ask questions from Probability then. ( He was from Maths dept, but an AI researcher)

Me: Sure sir.

I1: I am tossing a coin 10 times, it can have an outcome as Head or Tail. Now we define one Transition as if we get head then tails, or tails then head. What is the expected no. of transitions if I toss a coin 10 times?

Me: ( I had not solved any question from expectation for GATE, but I know the concept of it. So I gave my best in this question) ( I knew It would consume more time, so I explained each steps, while doing it, in order to break the silence).

(I formed the probability distribution for this random variable first. Calculated prob for x=0, 1, 2 and he asked to explain, how it is so, then I explained.)( it took 2, 3 minutes)

I1: now generalize it.

Me: ( I was able to generalize it after few minutes, meanwhile I kept explaining, what I was thinking). Final prob is 2 \* (n-1)Ck / 2^10 -\&gt; 9Ck / 2^9.

I1: good, What can you say about this distribution?

Me: (I knew it would be a binomial dist for sure, but what is the success and failure here?, So I was not able to tell this)

I1: do you know about Binomial distribution?

Me: Yes sir, it is binomial dist., but I am not able to find what is success here.

I1: no need of success. It is a binomial dist. now, what is the expectation of it?

Me: expectations of binomial dist. Is = np =\&gt; 10(½)

I1: n is 9 here, and p is ½ so fine expecations would be 9/2 = 4.5. Ok your thinking is good.

I1: How is your programming, DSA skills. Which language you know?

Me: Sir I know C++ for coding. I have done many questions in competitive coding platforms.

And I know python also , as I have done my B. Tech project on ML.

I1: What is the biggest C++ program/ Software that you have written?

Me: I have done only coding questions on C++, not made any systems software using c++.

I1: you would have done your B.Tech project right?. What is that?

Me: Yes Sir, it is based on Deep Learning. Where I was classifying the images that are drawn on the canvas.

I1: so you know deep learning. What is an Activation function?

Me: we have layers in a neural network, if we need to calculate the value for a neuron, then we multiply activation values and their respective weights and add with biases, and apply an activation function on this value.

I1: you know about perceptron?.........

(then he asked something about perceptron, that I was not able to answer, I was answering perceptron as a neuron)

I1: How will you make a AND gate using Perceptron?

Me: (after 10 seconds), I will make both weights as ½, then I will get a

1 if both inputs are 1, and

½ if one of them is 1,

and 0 for both inputs 0. Now I can decide by seeing this value. 1 means the o/p is 1, else o/p is 0.

I1: what you put as a bias to do this.

Me: I put bias as 0. Then to decide, I use the activation function. Like I can use floor() as an activation function.

I1: but it is not an activation function Ok, what are the different activation functions we have?

Me: relu, sigmoid, softmax.

I1: what is sigmoid?

Me: this will take values from -infinity - +infinity to 0-1.

I1: what is its function?

Me: 1/(1+e^(-x))

I1: ok, what if I make -x as x? What happens to this function?

Me: ok sir I will show you the graph of it.

(then I make the graph for sigmoid function and the modified(-x to x) function)

I1: ok good.( he seems satisfied)

I1: In which specific field do you want to work in AI? Like NLP, Computer Vision, etc.

Me: I know deep learning as of now. But I haven&#39;t done any formal course on ML, I wanted to do it in NLP but first, need to learn it.

I1: have you applied under any professors in CSE MSR? Which professors?

Me: I have applied under Mausam Sir since his research area is NLP.

I1: have you seen his research papers and any specific research area in which you are interested?

Me: not any particular area as of now.

I1: ok I&#39;m done from my side.

I2: ok now as you have not done any formal course on ML, I will ask some problem to see how you will think? Then he had drawn a graph for classification as in SVM. and asked should I draw the decision boundary as vertical or tilted? And why?

Me: (then some discussion happened for 4,5 minutes and I have given some reasons, but not able to give a concrete answer,)

I2: ok fine, no problem. Back to you chair.

I1: ok Suraj, I am from maths dept, but I am also working in NLP, I have my research area as x, y, z etc( he explained about his research areas). Are you interested in any of these?

Me: yes sir, I am interested in text summarization.

I1: ok, I will talk to you later. Done you can leave.

Me: thank you so much sir.

(Acc to his attitude, I knew that I have a high chance of getting selected here.)

I was very happy after this interview.

Result: Selected :)
