**IISC MTech(Res) CDS Interview Experience**

Written Test was held on 7 May 2021

Result of written: 12 May

Interview Date: 21 May

There were 2 professors ( main head of VCL Lab and VAL Lab)

**Interviewer-1:**

- Why do you want to join these Labs ( VCL, VAL, DREAM)
- You have two matrices A and B nxn , Do the eigenvalues of AB and BA same ?

(then I was not able to find ans, and said No, but then he asked:

- How you calculate the eigenvalues of a matrix?

Me: written and shown to them on webcam.

- What is Ax here?

Me: Ax is any vector in the column space of A. and then explained why

|Ax-lambda I| should be equal to 0

- Now that you have told me how to calculate eigenvalues tell do AB and BA share the eigenvalues.

Me: then started with their equations to find evalues,( then he given some hint that how to proceed). Then I got the answer that I was wrong and AB and BA share the evalues.

- Then he asked Do you know about \*\*\* (I forgot what it was, heard it the first time).

Me: No

**Interviewer-2:**

- What is Classification and Regression Problem?
- What are multiclass and multilabel classification?
- Can you tell the loss function for the classification problem?
- What is the equation for binary\_crossentropy?

Me: I don&#39;t know, I have used it using Keras only, didn&#39;t know about basics of it.

- What is the loss function used in the Regression Problem?

Okay done from our side. Thank You.
