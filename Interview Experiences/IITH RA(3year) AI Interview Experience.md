# **IITH RA(3year) AI Interview Experience**

They have not shared the shortlisting criteria. It might me around 700 GS.

(I&#39;m not sure about this)

My Gate Score: 731

**Round 1 : Written Round**

- Date: 6 july 2021
- Duration of Test: 1 hour
- No. of questions : 17 ( Numerical type and MCQ both were there)
- They have shared the syllabus: Linear Algebra, Discrete Structures, Probability, DSA.
- Questions were mainly from Data Structures, Algorithms, Linear Algebra.
- Questions were on easier side than GATE level. Only Linear Algebra questions were little bit on a tougher side. (I am not able to recall the questions)
- Even 1 hour seems to be more. One could complete that test in 40 minutes.

I was shortlisted. They have not shared the no. of shortlisted candidates. In my panel 23 candidates were there. There might be 1 or 2 panel.

**Round 1 : Interview Round**

I2 is [Dr. Sathya Sir](https://www.iith.ac.in/~sathya_p/). I didn&#39;t remember name of other Profs.

I1: Suraj introduce yourself.

Me: My name is Suraj Patni, I am in my final year of Computer Science Engineering. My CGPA is 8.85. And I am interested in AI, so I have done the courses on Linear Algebra and Probability to prepare for that.

I2: Have you done any formal course on AI?

Me: No sir I have not done. But I have read a book on Deep Learning by Francois Chollet.

I2: I will ask you questions from core Computer science subjects. Tell me what subjects you are comfortable with?

Me: Data Structures and Algorithms, In maths Linear Algebra.

I2: I will not ask from Linear Algebra. I will start with DSA.

(which subjects he ask will totally depend on which professor you get, If he would&#39;ve offered any course in LA, then he would&#39;ve asked from LA only )

Me: What data structure is your favourite?

Me: Binary Search Tree ( I just said, whatever came first in my mind)

I2: How you will you find the minimum element of a BST?

Me: the leftmost leaf will be the minimum element.

I2: what if there would be no left node?

Me: the root will be the min element

I2: how will you find the second minimum element?

Me: the parent of the leftmost node will be the 2nd min element

I2: what if there is no left node?

Me: the inorder successor of the root node will be the 2nd min.

I2: what is that?

Me: the leftmost leaf node of the right subtree.

I2: ok, you have a BST given. And a number b given. Now you need to check whether we have 2 values in BST whose sum is b.

Me: I will find the inorder traversal of the BST. Now this array will be sorted. In this I will take 2 pointers one at the start, second at the end of the array. Now I will find the sum of both elements of array, if the sum \&lt; b then I will increment the left pointer. If the sum \&gt; b then I will decrement the right pointer.

I2: will it work always?

Me: Yes sir

(then I2 took some call. And asked I1 to continue)

I1: Are you comfortable in basic Maths &amp; Probability?

Me: Yes sir

I1: what are independent events?

Me: (explained with example and formula)

I1: what is event A and event B in your example? And how does that formula work in your example?

Me: (done some mistake in this, but he said to try again, then explained correctly)

I1: Now I will ask you some graph plotting.

Me: sure sir

I1: Draw the graph of f(x) = 1/(1+e^(-1))

Me: (drawn and shown in the webcam) Sir, it is the popular activation function that is known as sigmoid function.

I1: when this function will take maximum value?

Me: It will take max value at x = infinity and that value is 1

I1: Is this function always increasing? How will you check that?

Me: yes sir, it is always increasing. We can see by looking at the graph.

I1: how to prove it?

Me: sir we will calculate f&#39;(x) then we will see that f&#39;(x) is always \&gt; 0 so this function is always increasing.

I1: ok I&#39;m done. Anyone wants to ask now?

I2: How will you check if an array is sorted or not?

Me: I will check every consecutive element that whether the left element is less than the right element or not. It will take O(n) time.

I2: there is an array given which have the Arithmetic Progression series? How will you check that have AP or not?

Me: I will use the similar algo.

I2: okay. Now they are not in a sequence. You can rearrange them to form AP. now how will you check that whether they will form an AP or not?

Me: I will sort the array in O(nlogn) time and check in O(n) time. So it will take O(nlogn) time.

I2: Can you optimise it?

(Meanwhile he asked I1 that how much time we have. Then I1 said we are done from our side. So this question would be the last one) (now I know that there is high chance of selection now).

Me: (after 3 minutes) I will calc the max and min element in O(n) time. I will take min as first element and max as last element. Then I fumbled (was not able to do that and said something here and there.)

I2: ok fine. We are done.

I1: Where other places have you applied.

Me: I have got some offers for Mtech from new IITs, so I will surely go with IITH.

I2: Do you know it is a 3 year program? And research based?

Me: Yes sir I am aware of that.

I1: ok, Best of Luck.

Me: Thank you so much sir.

Result:

Dr. Sathya sir called me on 21st July saying that we are sending you the offer letter. Before sending that we want to ask u that are you still available or have u accepted elsewhere.

Me: Sir, I am selected for IITD, so I am considering that.

Sathya sir: OK fine then. Thanks for the info. Good Luck.

Me: Thank you so much sir.
