# **IIT Delhi MSR Interview**

# **(CSE)**

The cutoff was: 700 gate score. UG marks : 75% (7.5 CGPA)

My GATE score: 731 general. (rank 510)

**146 candidates** were shortlisted using this cutoff.

**Round 1: Coding Test (7th June)**

- 5 questions(100 marks each) in 2 hours.
- Questions were mostly on arrays and matrices. (medium level questions)
- Tip: all ques were of equal marks, you could choose easy questions first.

I have done 3.5 questions out of that. (Some of my friends did 2.5, so cutoff was around 2.5 questions)

Then **26 candidates** were shortlisted for interview. I was one of them.

They have divided them into AI and non-AI.

They said in the mail that &quot; **the interview in AI panel is going to be much more competitive since there are more candidates in this area. If you would also like to interview in the non-AI panel and open to non-AI or AI-application areas, please let us know.&quot;**

Interviews were conducted from 9th June to 11th June.

The interview was online via Microsoft teams. And they are taking phd interviews also parallelly.

MSR candidates are sandwiched b/w them on that day.

**Round 2: Online Interview (9th June)**

Both Professors were there under which I had applied (Prof. Mausam and Prof. Chetan Arora). Some others were also there. But total 3 profs. had asked me questions.

Let Mausam Sir: Im, Chetan Arora Sir: Ic, Sayan Ranu Sir: Is

Is: one of the professors read my details.( name, cgpa,etc ) and asked what position do you stand in your class. (I replied)

Another prof asked for my college name. (I replied)

Is: As you have just done your B.Tech. what have you prepared like CS subjects, etc

Me: Sir, I have found it out that in order to learn AI, ML, one should learn Linear Algebra first. So I have prepared Linear Algebra.

Im: Are you comfortable with Probability?

Me: Sir I know discrete, but I am not confident in Continuous Probability.

Im(Mausam SIr): ok we&#39;ll just ask basics. XII level probability.

Me: ok fine sir.

Im: In IIT Delhi there is a Tea Chain Chaayos(it&#39;s a startup by IITD students), just like Coffee chains. Do you know about it?

Me: No sir.

Im: In this Tea chain, they have n different kinds of spices to have in your tea like elaichi, adrak, etc. You can have none also. So how many different kinds of Tea can you have?

Me: 2^n.

Im: How?

Me: there are 2 choices for every spice whether to take it or not. So 2\*2\*2...n times. = 2^n.

Im; Suppose I am asking for a tea having 3 spices. What is the probability that the tea has elaichi in it?

Me: (after 10 second). Sir no of favorable cases are (n-1)(n-2) and total cases are 2^n.

Im: don&#39;t be in a hurry. Think properly. Take your tIme. I am asking for a tea having 3 spices.

Me: got it, sir. total cases would be n(n-1)(n-2). So probability would be 1/n.

Im: ok. Now Are you considering here the order also like

Case 1: elaichi, adrak is different from adrak, elaichi.

Case 2: both are the same. No order.

So which case have you taken? and how you will calc for the other case?

( I have said opposite earlier(due to nervousness), then Sir tried to take me to the right result by asking some basic questions like: what is the no of ways to choose r objects from n. And what is it if we consider the order of selecting also……...then I interrupted hIm and said that now I got it, Sir)

Me: I have said wrong. 1/n would be the probability for the case where we consider the order.

Im: Now tell what is prob if we don&#39;t consider the order?

Me: (n-1)C2 / nC3

Im: ok, it&#39;s done from my side.

Ic(Chetan Arora Sir): Draw the graph of log(x/2) base 2.

Me: drawn(meet x-axis at x=2) and shown in webcam.

Im: what happens at the ends, when x close to 0. And x = infinity?

Me: Sir y=0 would be the asymptote for this graph.And at x=infinity I think it goes to infinity..

Ic: Now I will ask something from Data Stuctures. You have k lists, how do you merge them.

Me:(after 20 seconds) we will take k pointers, one for every list. Then I will find the minImum out of them and increment that pointer. And keep on doing this… But this will take much more tIme. I will optImize it.

Ic: ok what tIme does it take?

Me: O(n.k^2)

Ic: How. explain?

Me: For calculating minImum from that k pointers, it will take O(k) tIme. And totally there are kn elements. So total tIme woud be k\*kn. (they have given that each list will have n elements).

Im: just tell me Is there optImization possible.

(I think they are running out of tIme. So not given chance to optImize)

Is: Are you sure about what area do you want to work in ML?

Me: I will do some courses, then I will find my research interest. As of now, I have done some mini projects on deep learning using the Keras library.

Is: Have you done any formal course on Machine Learning?

Me: No

Is: what have you done in Deep learning?

Me: I have made some basic models on binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression.

Im: you have a vector, whose all values are in the range of -infinity to +infinity. Then how will you convert this to a probability distribution? Where all values are from 0 to 1 and they sum to 1.

Me: sir there is a function in numpy that is interp([1,255], [0,1]) which will take each no. from 0-255 range to 0-1 range.

Im: but here the no.s are in range -infinity to +infinity. How will you do here?

Me: Sir I will use sigmoid function?

Im: what is that. Can you tell its equation (value)?

Me: 1/(1+e^(-x))

Im: how will you convert that vector using this?

Me: (after 10 sec) sir I will take every value of vector as x to calc the corresponding value of y.

Ic: What is the graph of sigmoid function?

Me: drawn and shown.

Im: But we want prob. Dist. will your vector have prob distribution?

Me: No sir.

Im: How will you convert that to prob dist?

Me: sum all those values and divide every value of that vector by that sum.

Im: ok done from my side.

Ic: where all other places have you applied?

Me: Madras and Bombay. Sir, But I will consider IIT Delhi for sure if I will get selected.

Ic: ok Suraj Thank You. you can leave

Me: Thank you so much, Sir.

Duration: 25 minutes.

Result: Selected :)
