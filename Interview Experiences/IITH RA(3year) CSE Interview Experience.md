# **IITH RA(3year) CSE Interview Experience**

There were 2 rounds of interviews for CSE.

**Round 1 intereview.**

Date: 2 july 2021

I1: Are you comfortable with Data Structures and Algorithms?

Me: Yes sir

I1: I have trillions of numbers (Aadhar Numbers) in an array. And I need to search for a number in that array, what preprocessing would you do?

Me: Sir, I will use the Trie data structure. And I store all the numbers in the trie, then I can search easily.

I1: If I have no.s only in the range of 1 to 1000, then what you will use?

Me: I use the Hashing for that, I use an array of size 1000, then I increment the values of that index whenver we find a no. in that array.

I1: what is the time complexity of quick sort?

Me: in worst case, it is O(n^2)

I1: can you decrease that?

Me: yes we can find the median in O(n) then use median as a pivot. Then it would come down to O(nlogn).

I1: how you will find median?

Me:(after sometime) I am not able to recall right now.

I2: Suraj, I am giving you a puzzle. How you will show that value of pi is less that 4, using figures like square, triangle, circle, etc?

Me: (after sometimes) I will use a thread to measure the diameter of a circle, then I will take a thread with length 4 times of that diameter, Now if I try to cover the circumference of the circle using that thread, then it would be more that circumference. It will show that 2r\*pi \&lt; 2r\*4

So pi \&lt; 4.

I2: how will u do it without using thread, using that figures, may be their area and all?

Me: (I was not able to give it&#39;s answer and just told him what I was thinking). Sir I will take a square inscribed in a circle, then its diagonal and circle&#39;s diameter are same. (Then I was not able to proceed and asked for hints).

I2: you are close to the answer, you have just said it.

Me: (not able to get).

I2: how will you show value of pi is greater than 3,

Me: (not able to get).

I2: you have just said it earlier.

I3: Are you comfortable in BST?

Me: Yes Ma&#39;am

I3: how will you make the BST so that its preorder and inorder will be same? Obviously it have more that 1 node.

Me: (I have made it for 2 nodes and shown)

I3: how will you make it for more nodes. What structure will you use?

Me: Ma&#39;am and right skewed tree will work here.

I1: ok, suraj your intereview is done. You can leave and Best of luck for results.

Me: thank you so much.

Duration: 20 min

- 33 candidates were shortlisted for the 2nd round of interview.(my name was there)

**Round 2 intereview.**

Date: 5 july 2021

I1(Antony Sir): Suraj, What are your skillsets?

Me: I have few projects on Deep Learning. And I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, for which I have prepared Linear Algebra and Probability.

(I1 asked I2 to proceed.)

I2(vineeth Sir): What is rank and nullity theorem?

Me: it says that the sum of the dimensions of rowspace and nullspace is equal to n.

I2: what is n here?

Me: it is the no. of columns or no. of variables.

I2: what is nullspace here?

Me: suppose we have a matrix A, then all the solutions to the equation Ax=0 will form a space, that is known as nullspace.

I2: do you know about singular value decomposition,......(some other high level concepts, which I didn&#39;t know)

Me: No sir.

I2: where we can use linear algebra in ML?

Me: We use it in Deep learning, where we use weights and biases. We take weights in matrix and biases in a vector and multiply, and use LA there.

I2: But where we are using Linear Algebra here?

Me: I don&#39;t know exactly where it is used?

I2: How do you know that LA and Prob is required for ML?

Me: Some of the seniors told me that in order to go for ML, you should prepare LA, Prob and it&#39;ll be helpful for interviews also.

I2: So you have not done any formal course on ML right?

Me: no sir, I haven&#39;t done. I just read a book on Deep Learning by Franchois Chollet.

I2: ok, now others might ask some questions or it&#39;s done.

I3: Are you interested in other areas?

I1: No I think, he said ML only.

I1: ok thank you suraj and Best of Luck

Me: Thank you so much Sir.

Duration : 10 to 12 min.

**TL;DR :**

- IITH generally focuses on DSA, coding (these are the mandatory subjects, because it will be helpful in every other interview).
- They have not asked to prepare a particular subject(at least in round1).
- IITH ask short questions and don&#39;t go deep in that unlike IITM, D, B, IISC.
- Prepare all the general/frequent questions of any subject that you are preparing for interview.
- If you prepare 2,3 subjects, you can face all the IIT interviews. They will not ask subjects in which you are not comfortable with.
