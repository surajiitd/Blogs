- You have an R^3. If I apply a transformation in which I scale every 3 axes by some scaler value, then what will be the eigenvector?
- In that R^3, If I shift the origin to some other place and invert one of the axes, then what will be the vector coordinate for a vector in new space acc. to the original space.( nearly this is what he asked)( I was not able to answer ) so he said:
- OK just tell me What will be the transformation matrix for vector addition.
- He said &quot;OK, Done from my side&quot;

Interviewer 2:

- Are u aware of argmax() fun .What is difference b/w argmax() function and max() function?
- What is Bays Theorem?
- How will u find a person who has Cancer or not using Bays theorem? Formulate it.
- OK, you have a vector having a patient&#39;s details. Then how will u find out ?. Where do use argmax() function there?
